Basic Selectors : 
    to apply style to multiple element we need to select to elemnet for that we use selectors. 
    Most commen selectors are : 
        i - Tag Name selectors : it is used to seelct all  elements of specific tsg name.
            tagname{
                propeties:values;
            }

        ii - class is attribute to element which use to select multiple  elements ,
            one elements may contion multiple class names and multiple elements may 
            contion the same class name
                .classname{
                    property:value;
                    ...
                    ...
                }

        iii - id ==> id is used to identify an elements uniqualy. 
                No two elements have same id and no elements will contian more then one id
                id > class >tagname 

        iv - universal selectors ==> if you wnat apply to all elements in a webpage 
            you can use universal selector (*) 
            *{
                text-align:center;
            }
