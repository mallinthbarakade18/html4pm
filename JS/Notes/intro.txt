Javascript : Javascript is a client side programming language which is used to build interactive website 
            using HTML and CSS.
            Javascript controls the behaviour of web pages and provides functionality to the webpages

            --Javascript was created a 1995(dec 4) by Breden Eich while working at Netscape.
                    Initially is is named as Mocha letter change as LiveScript. to use popurarity of java ,
                    Livescript renamed as Javascript

            Javascript runs in the Browesers becouse every Broweser Contains an engine to run javascript 
            called js Engine.

            The popular js engine are V8(chrome) ,xspiderMonkey(Mozilla),chakra(edge).
            It can also run without browsers .on server called node js

            javascript is high level dynamic programming language that makes websites alive 
            Think building website like Building a house 

            HTML --> the walls,windows,doors,(Structure)--what we server
            CS   --> Paintin,decorations,styles -----how its looks
            Js   --> electricity,water,switches  ---How its works
            


            How to include javascript in html ?
            --> we can include javascript in two ways they are
                1. Internal javascript
                2. External javascript

            1...Internal javascript :
                    we can include using 'script' as element
                        
                        eg: <script>
                                here you can write javascript
                            </script>
            
            2...External JAvascript :
                    we can include external javascript file(.js file) to html using script tag with src 'attribute'
                    
                    <script src="filepath"></script>

    In javascript there are two types of Commentes 
        1.. single line ==> //
        2.. Multi line  ==> /* comment */
    comments are used for user readablity purpose

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Varibles in Javascript :
    in javascript we can declared using keywords such as ("var,let,const")
    variables / literals are used to store the values 

    Difference between let ,var and const ==>
             var                    |             let                 |         const
                                    |                                 | const variables can not be 
var variable can be redeclared.     |   let and const cannot be       | changed                           
 eg : var a=10;                     |   redecalred                    |
        a=20;                       |                                 |
var variables can v=be changed      |   let varibles you can aslo be  |
    eg : var a=10;                  |   changed                       |
            a=20;                   |   eg :let a=10;                 |
                                    |            b=20;                |
var variables are function scoped   |   let and const are block       |
                                    |   scoped variables              |



To accept input ,we use one method called promt ,but promt accepts only strings.
let a = +prompt("Enter a value");

(+) is convert string datatype  to another datatype

DataTpes in Javascript :

    javascript is a dynamaic programming language . it means in javascript there is no fixed datatype
    in javascript to a variable .the datatype of a variable is decided by value  it is holding.

    There are two categories of datatypes :
        1 primitive datatype
        2 non primitive datatype

    1 ..primitive datatype :
        These datatype holds the value and comapres only value these datatypes in immuteable.
        There are 5 primitive datatype such as :
         1. number 
         2. string
         3. boolean
         4. undefined
         5. null
    
    Non - primitive datatype :
        This datatypes holds the value and comapres the address and refernce. these datatype are muteable.
        The basic non primitive datatypes are 
        1. function
        2. arrays
        3. objects

Can w change one datype to another dataype?
--> the process of changing one datatype to another datatype is call type casting .
    there are two types of type casting :
        1. implicit Typecasting : 
        2. explicit Typecasting :
        
        
        1. implicit Typecasting : 
            it is default or automatic conversion of datatypes based on opearation
            eg :10 + "5" =105(because number and string not added)

            eg : 5+4 =20,
            5+'4'='54',
            5 + + '4'=9,
            5*'4'=20 
        2. explicit Typecasting :
            it is the forced eay of converting one dataype to another   
                eg:5 + + '4'==> 5 + 4 ==> 9
                5 + Number('4') ==> 9
            
 number : any numirical value is number
            eg:4
            eg:4.5
        Every number can hava default methods such as toString,toPrecision etc...,
        numbers  also have math methods such as sqrt,cbrt,pow,ceil,floar etc...,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date : 11/09/2025

1. toFixted() : it is used to return roundup value of n decimal digits
2. toPrecision() : it is used roundup value of n total digits
3. toString() : it is used to convert number to a string and differnt base system
            eg : let x=25.4164;
                x.toFixted(2) = 25.41
                x.toPrecision(3) = 25.4
                x = 25 ;
                x.toString(2) = 11001
    
    Most used Math Methods are :
            Math.sqrt(16)--returns square root of 16 is 4
            Math.cbrt(27)--returns cube root 27 is 3
            Math.pow(2,3) -- returns 2 power 3 is 8
            same thing can be done like (2**3) =8
            
            Math.abs(-5)--retuens absolute value is always positive =5
            Math.max(5,1,6,8) -- return maximum value =8
            Math.min(5,1,6,8) -- retuens minimum value =1
            Math.ceil(2.2) -- retuens nearest max value =3
            Math.floor(2.2) -- retuens nearest min value =2
            MAth.round(4.2) -- returns nearest integer = 4
            Math.random() -- returns random value 0 and 1
    
String : string is collection of characters
        eg : "abc123", "abc def" // space also count

    ---String can be writtern single or double quotes.
    ---There is no difference between but used alternatively in nested strings
    ---String can also dynamic called "template literal". it uses backticks for strings and ${}
       for dynamic values 

    let x="jhon"
    console,log(`The name is ${x}`) // The name is jhon
