            1...Internal javascript :
                    we can include using 'script' as element
                        
                        eg: <script>
                                here you can write javascript
                            </script>
            
            2...External JAvascript :
                    we can include external javascript file(.js file) to html using script tag with src 'attribute'
                    
                    <script src="filepath"></script>

    In javascript there are two types of Commentes 
        1.. single line ==> //
        2.. Multi line  ==> /* comment */
    comments are used for user readablity purpose

    in javascript we can declared using keywords such as ("var,let,const")
    variables / literals are used to store the values 

    Difference between let ,var and const ==>
             var                    |             let                 |         const
                                    |                                 | const variables can not be 
var variable can be redeclared.     |   let and const cannot be       | changed                           
 eg : var a=10;                     |   redecalred                    |
        a=20;                       |                                 |
